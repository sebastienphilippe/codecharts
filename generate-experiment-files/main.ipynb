    "Another bit of terminology and experimental logistics involves **buckets** which are a way to distribute experiment stimuli so that multiple experiments can be run in parallel (and participants can be reused for different subsets of images). If you have a lot of images that you want to collect data on, and for each participant you are sampling a set of only #`num_images_per_sf`, then you might have to generate a large `num_subject_files` in order to have enough data points per image. A way to speed up data collection is to split all the target images into #`num_buckets` disjoint buckets, and then to generate subject files per bucket. Given that subject files generated per bucket are guaranteed to have a disjoint set of images, the same participant can be run on multiple subject files from different buckets. MTurk HITs corresponding to different buckets can be launched all at once. In summary, in MTurk terms, you can generate as many HITs as `num_buckets` specified below, and as many assignments per HIT as `num_subject_files`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The way the codecharts methodology works, a jittered grid of alphanumeric triplets appears after every image presentation (whether it is a target, sentinel, or tutorial image), since a participant will need to indicate where on the preceding image s/he looked, by reporting a triplet. To avoid generating an excessive number of codecharts (that bulks up all the subject files), we can reuse some codecharts across buckets. The way we do this is by pre-generating #`ncodecharts` codecharts, and then randomly sampling from these when generating the individual subject files."
